BUG Report
- Safari on Mac has serious issues with the blurry background glitching through

NOTES
- Peformance issue was due to blur on the headings to create the halation effect
-- Pefromance issue was due to iframe code missing from LENIS!!!!!
- Very high GPU usage -> One reason is that SVG render uses too much gpu!
- Defer only works with hosted files, not local dev!
- Fixed initial flash by setting Opacity:0 on start of page load to elements that flash
- jsdelivr automatically minifies files when using .min.js extention!

// Version 2:
- Create Barba transitions
- Add swiper to gallery for multiple images
- Create gsap flip animation from masonry grid to list
- Swiper Thumbnail controller instead of arrows, especially for works section
